# ptfe-demo-mode-tls
This repo is guideline on:
- TFE version 4 demo install using TLS certificate
- TFE version 4 restore from snapshot

There are two types of installation (Online or Airgapped).
We will focus on Online installation.


We are going to use vagrant in order to create appropriate development environment for that.
Our VM configuration include:
- private IP address (192.168.56.33) 
- /dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-root 83GB
- /dev/mapper/vagrant--vg-var_lib 113G

## Repo Content
| File                   | Description                      |

| [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) | Vagrant template file. TFE env is going to be cretated based on that file|
| [delete_all.sh](delete_all.sh) | Purpose of this script is to break our environment. We will use it during snapshot restore|

## Requirements
Please make sure you have fullfilled the reqirements before continue further:
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed
- Hashicorp [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed
- [Basic Vagrant skills](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/) 
- PTFE license (You can contact Sales Team of HashiCorp - sales@hashicorp.com in order to purchase one)
- your own SSL/TLS certificates - In case you do not have such, you can generate for free using [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) 

## Getting started
- Clone this repo locally
```
git clone https://github.com/berchev/ptfe-demo-mode-tls.git
```
- Change into downloaded repo directory
```
cd ptfe-demo-mode-tls
```

## PTFE version 4 demo install using your own SSL/TLS certificate
- Start provision vagrant development environment
```
vagrant up
```
- connect to newly provisioned Vagrant machine
```
vagrant ssh
```
- Become `root`
```
sudo su -
```
- change to /vagrant directory (This is shared directory between the Host and the VM. It is better to keep the important stuff there.)
```
cd /vagrant
```
- Run the TFE installer from the shell of your instance, in order to start interractive installation
```
curl https://install.terraform.io/ptfe/stable | sudo bash
```
- Choose interface for TFE
```bash
vagrant@ptfe:/vagrant# curl https://install.terraform.io/ptfe/stable | sudo bash

Operator installation successful

To continue the installation, visit the following URL in your browser:

  http://<this_server_address>:8800

vagrant@ptfe:/vagrant#
```

- Open your browser and type: `https://192.168.56.33:8800`, in oder to continue with the installation on UI
- Click on `Advanced`, since we are using self-signed certificate

## TFE version 4 restore from snapshot
Once we have installed TFE, we would like to have a snapshot of the last stable state. That's why we will create snapshot.
- In your browser type: `https://ptfe.georgiman.com:8800/dashboard`
- Click on `Start Snapshot` and wait the process to complete:
![](https://github.com/berchev/ptfe-demo-mode-tls/blob/master/screenshots/12.png)

- In order to verify that everything works as expected, we will break our system and then will restore it from snapshot

- Go to Terminal shell, become root
```
sudo su -
```

```
bash delete_all.sh 
```

```
exit
```

```
vagrant reload
```
- ssh to your VM again
```
vagrant ssh
```
- become root
```
